common-substrings
================

####a method for finding all common strings for Javascript and node.js, which is particularly quick for large string samples.
================

###Usage

####Quickstart
Give the array as input parameter.

    var SuffixTrie= require('common-substrings');
    var tree =  new SuffixTrie();
    tree.build(array);
    var fragmentResult1 = tree.weightByAverage();
    var fragmentResult2 = tree.weightByMax();

####Methods
There are two method to get the fragments:
- one is `weightByAverage()` : which rank the fragment by the product of the fragment length and fragment occurrence.
- one is `weightByMax()` : the process is trival, but main idea is rank the longest fragment in the longest string to the first.

Both method return an Object array, each element in the array include :
- `source` : the index of the labels which contais this fragment,
- `name` : the name of the fragment,
- `weight` : the product of the fragment length and the fragment occurrence


####Conifguration
You may set the options of the algorithm when initialization.

    var tree = new SuffixTrie({
        minLength : 5, //the minimum length of fragment
        minOccurrence : 3 , //the minimin occurrence of fragment
        debug : false  //whether to show the console messages
    });

the default values are:
- `minLength` : 3
- `minOccurrence` : 2
- `debug` : true

####Example Result
if we have the array `['java', 'javascript','pythonscript']`, by the default setting, we will get result array:

        [
          {name : 'java', source : [0,1], weight : 8},
          {name : 'script', source : [1,2], weight : 10}
        ]

####Demo
A practical demo is placed in demo folder, and I already download mongoose for windows here.
You may use mongoose server to have a quick look on how to make the algorithm into practical. Don't forget to use console to see all the informations.
